Welcome to My Django Projects Repository
Hello and welcome to my Django journey!

This repository is dedicated to all my Django projects, starting with this week's introduction to Django. 
It’s been quite the adventure so far, with plenty of documentation reading,
and yes—my head does hurt a bit from it all! 😅

For now, this is a general overview of my Django projects. 
Each weekly project will be described in detail within its respective directory and README file.

About This Week's Project:
This week's project can be found in the LibraryProject directory. 
If you're interested in the details, please check out the README file inside that folder.

Additionally, you'll find a list of dependencies required for the virtual environment in the requirements.txt file.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore Django!
