Welcome to My Django Projects Repository
Hello and welcome to my Django journey!

This repository is dedicated to all my Django projects, starting with this week's introduction to Django. 
Itâ€™s been quite the adventure so far, with plenty of documentation reading,
and yesâ€”my head does hurt a bit from it all! ðŸ˜…

For now, this is a general overview of my Django projects. 
Each weekly project will be described in detail within its respective directory and README file.

About This Week's Project:
This week's project overview can be found in the LibraryProject directory. 
If you're interested in the details, please checkout the README file inside that folder.

Additionally, you'll find a list of dependencies required for the virtual environment in the requirements.txt file.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore Django!
